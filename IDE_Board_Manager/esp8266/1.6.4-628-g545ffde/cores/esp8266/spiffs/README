* INTRODUCTION

Spiffs is a file system intended for SPI NOR flash devices on embedded targets.

Spiffs is designed with following characteristics in mind:
 - Small (embedded) targets, sparse RAM without heap
 - Only big areas of data (blocks) can be erased
 - An erase will reset all bits in block to ones
 - Writing pulls one to zeroes
 - Zeroes can only be pulled to ones by erase
 - Wear leveling


* FEATURES

What spiffs does:
 - Specifically designed for low ram usage
 - Uses statically sized ram buffers, independent of number of files
 - Posix-like api: open, close, read, write, seek, stat, etc
 - It can be run on any NOR flash, not only SPI flash - theoretically also on
   embedded flash of an microprocessor
 - Multiple spiffs configurations can be run on same target - and even on same
   SPI flash device
 - Implements static wear leveling 
 - Built in file system consistency checks
 
What spiffs does not:
 - Presently, spiffs does not support directories. It produces a flat
   structure. Creating a file with path "tmp/myfile.txt" will create a file 
   called "tmp/myfile.txt" instead of a "myfile.txt" under directory "tmp". 
 - It is not a realtime stack. One write operation might take much longer than
   another.
 - Poor scalability. Spiffs is intended for small memory devices - the normal
   sizes for SPI flashes. Going beyond ~128MB is probably a bad idea. This is
   a side effect of the design goal to use as little ram as possible.
 - Presently, it does not detect or handle bad blocks.

* HISTORY

0.3.0
  Added existing namecheck when creating files
  Lots of static analysis bugs #6
  Added rename func
  Fix SPIFFS_read length when reading beyond file size
  Added reading beyond file length testcase
  Made build a bit more configurable
  Changed name in spiffs from "errno" to "err_code" due to conflicts compiling
    in mingw
  Improved GC checks, fixed an append bug, more robust truncate for very special
    case
  GC checks preempts GC, truncate even less picky
  Struct alignment needed for some targets, define in spiffs config #10
  Spiffs filesystem magic, definable in config

  New config defines:
    SPIFFS_USE_MAGIC - enable or disable magic check upon mount
    SPIFFS_ALIGNED_OBJECT_INDEX_TABLES - alignment for certain targets
  New API functions:
    SPIFFS_rename - rename files
    SPIFFS_clearerr - clears last errno
    SPIFFS_info - returns info on used and total bytes in fs
    SPIFFS_format - formats the filesystem
    SPIFFS_mounted - checks if filesystem is mounted
