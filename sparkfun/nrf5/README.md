# Arduino Core for Nordic Semiconductor nRF5 based boards

Program [Nordic Semiconductor](https://www.nordicsemi.com) nR5 based boards with the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) IDE.

## Supported boards

 * [nRF52 DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-Smart-Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF52-DK)
   * For boards prior to ```2016.9``` (see sticker), the lastest JLink bootloader is required to upload sketches. To upgrade, press the boot/reset button while powering on the board and copy over the latest [bootloader](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/Products/nRF52-DK/nRF5x-OB-JLink-IF/52275).
 * [Bluz DK](http://bluz.io)
 * [RedBearLab BLE Nano](http://redbearlab.com/blenano/)
 * [RedBearLab nRF51822](http://redbearlab.com/redbearlab-nrf51822/)
 * [BBC micro:bit](https://www.microbit.co.uk/)
 * [OSHChip](http://www.oshchip.org/)

## Installing

### Board Manager

 1. [Download and install the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
 2. Start the Arduino IDE
 3. Go into Preferences
 4. Add ```https://sandeepmistry.github.io/arduino-nRF5/package_nRF5_boards_index.json``` as an "Additional Board Manager URL"
 5. Open the Boards Manager from the Tools -> Board menu and install "Nordic Semiconductor nRF5 Boards"
 6. Select your nRF5 board from the Tools -> Board menu

#### OS Specific Setup

##### OS X

No additional setup required.

##### Linux

No additional setup required.

#####  Windows

###### Driver Setup for Segger J-Link

 1. Download [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie)
 2. Plugin Segger J-Link or DK board
 3. Start ```Zadig```
 4. Select ```Options -> List All Devices```
 5. Select ```J-Link (Interface 2)``` from the device dropdown
 6. Click ```Replace Driver```

### Flashing a SoftDevice

 1. ```cd <SKETCHBOOK>```, where ```<SKETCHBOOK>``` is your Arduino Sketch folder:
  * OS X: ```~/Documents/Arduino```
  * Linux: ```~/Arduino```
  * Windows: ```~/Documents/Arduino```
 2. Create the following directories: ```tools/nRF5FlashSoftDevice/tool/```
 3. Download [nRF5FlashSoftDevice.jar](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-nRF5/releases/download/tools/nRF5FlashSoftDevice.jar) to ```<SKETCHBOOK>/tools/nRF5FlashSoftDevice/tool/```
 4. Restart the Arduino IDE
 5. Select your nRF board from the Tools -> Board menu
 6. Select a SoftDevice from the Tools -> "SoftDevice: " menu
 7. Select a Programmer (J-Link, ST-Link V2, or CMSIS-DAP) from the Tools -> "Programmer: " menu
 8. Select Tools -> nRF5 Flash SoftDevice
 9. Read license agreement
 10. Click "Accept" to accept license and continue, or "Decline" to decline and abort
 11. If accepted, SoftDevice binary will be flashed to the board

### From git (for core development)

 1. Follow steps from Board Manager section above
 2. ```cd <SKETCHBOOK>```, where ```<SKETCHBOOK>``` is your Arduino Sketch folder:
  * OS X: ```~/Documents/Arduino```
  * Linux: ```~/Arduino```
  * Windows: ```~/Documents/Arduino```
 3. Create a folder named ```hardware```, if it does not exist, and change directories to it
 4. Clone this repo: ```git clone https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-nRF5.git sandeepmistry/nRF5```
 5. Restart the Arduino IDE
